```
Why we built @APIShift:

You find out when customers complain.

Not anymore 👉 [PH LINK]

4️⃣ Detect ANY schema change
5️⃣ Alert you via Slack/Email instantly

Free plan: 3 APIs, no credit card

### Launch Day Announcement

```
🚀 Big news! We just launched APIShift on Product Hunt.

THE PROBLEM:
Last year, we experienced a 3-hour production outage because a payment provider changed their API response structure without notice.

Checkout broke. Revenue lost. Customers angry.

I learned that this happens constantly:
• Stripe updates their API
• Twilio changes response formats
• Third-party services rename critical fields
• Internal microservices push breaking changes

Companies find out when customers start complaining.

THE SOLUTION:
APIShift monitors your critical APIs 24/7 and detects schema changes within minutes.

You get instant alerts via Slack, Email, or PagerDuty the moment anything changes.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Add your API endpoints (REST, GraphQL, or gRPC)
2. We take baseline snapshots
3. Monitor every 5-60 minutes
4. Detect schema changes using deep diff analysis
5. Alert you instantly with before/after comparison

KEY FEATURES:
✅ Real-time schema diff detection
✅ Multi-channel alerts (Slack, Email, Discord, PagerDuty)
✅ Historical change tracking with snapshots
✅ Severity classification (CRITICAL → LOW)
✅ Support for REST, GraphQL, and gRPC
✅ Team collaboration with shared dashboards

PRICING:
Free plan available - 3 APIs with hourly monitoring. No credit card required.

We're live on Product Hunt RIGHT NOW.

If you've ever been burned by an unexpected API change, check it out:

Would love your thoughts and feedback!

### Day After - Lessons Learned Post

```
What we learned launching on Product Hunt yesterday:

Background:
We launched @APIShift and hit #[X] Product of the Day with [X] upvotes.

Here's what worked (and what didn't):

✅ WHAT WORKED:

1. Launched at 12:01 AM PST
   → Gave us full 24 hours of visibility
   → Early momentum is everything

2. Responded to EVERY comment within 10 minutes
   → Showed we care
   → Increased engagement
   → People noticed and appreciated it

3. Had a compelling GIF/demo
   → Visual storytelling > text
   → Our demo GIF got shared independently

4. Built in public beforehand
   → Had an audience ready to support
   → Pre-warmed my network

5. Maker's first comment was detailed
   → Set the tone
   → Answered questions proactively
   → Got [X] upvotes itself

❌ WHAT DIDN'T WORK:

1. Didn't prepare enough screenshots
   → Scrambled last minute
   → Could have shown more features

2. Posted in too many Slack groups
   → Came across as spammy
   → Focus on quality over quantity

3. Underestimated time commitment
   → Was glued to screen for 18 hours
   → Should have had team shifts

4. Pricing confusion
   → Should have been clearer upfront
   → Got same question 10+ times

📊 RESULTS:
- [X] upvotes
- [X] comments
- [X] website visits
- [X] sign-ups (Y% conversion)
- [X] new email subscribers

💡 BIGGEST SURPRISE:
The comments/questions led to [X] feature ideas we hadn't considered.

The real value wasn't the ranking - it was the feedback.

💰 ROI:
Time invested: ~20 hours
Cost: $0 (except design tools we already had)
New customers: [X]
Lifetime value: $[X]

Worth it? Absolutely.

Would I do it again? Yes, but with these improvements:
1. Better screenshot preparation
2. Team shifts for coverage
3. FAQ document ready
4. More targeted promotion
5. Follow-up sequence planned

ADVICE FOR FIRST-TIME LAUNCHERS:

1. Launch on Tue/Wed/Thu (not Mon/Fri)
2. Respond to every single comment
3. Be genuine, not salesy
4. Prepare visuals 1 week in advance
5. Have FAQ ready
6. Don't spam communities
7. Engage beyond just launch day
8. Make a special PH offer (we did 40% off)
9. Thank everyone who helps
10. Follow up afterward (like this post!)

**Title:** Just launched on Product Hunt - Real-time API monitoring

**Post:**
```
Hey IH community!

We just launched APIShift on Product Hunt and would love your feedback.

Background:
Been building this for [X months] after experiencing a $10K+ loss from an unexpected API change.

What it does:
Monitors your APIs (REST/GraphQL/gRPC) and alerts you instantly when schemas change.

Think: Stripe updates their API → You know in 5 minutes → Fix before customers notice.

Why I'm sharing here:
1. Would love IH community's feedback
2. Many of you use third-party APIs
3. Curious about the problem/solution fit

Not asking for upvotes - genuinely want to know:
- Is this a problem you face?
- What would make this more useful?
- What am I missing?

Product Hunt link: [LINK]
Website: https://www.apishift.site

Free tier available to test it out.

Thanks for being an awesome community! 🙏

### Hacker News (Post as "Show HN")

**Title:** Show HN: APIShift – Catch breaking API changes before they break production

**Post:**
```
Hey HN,

I built APIShift (https://www.apishift.site) - real-time monitoring for API schema changes.

Origin story:
Last year, a payment provider updated their API response structure without notice. Our checkout broke for 3 hours before we noticed. Lost $10K+ in revenue and customer trust.

I learned this happens constantly. Stripe updates their API. Twilio changes field names. Your microservices team pushes breaking changes. Companies find out when customers complain.

How it works:
1. You add API endpoints (REST/GraphQL/gRPC)
2. We take baseline snapshots
3. Monitor every 5-60 minutes
4. Detect schema changes using recursive diff algorithm
5. Alert via Slack/Email/PagerDuty with before/after comparison

Technical bits:
- Built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- Schema diff engine uses recursive comparison with type checking
- Supports nested objects, arrays, union types
- Severity classification based on change type (removal = CRITICAL, addition = LOW)
- Encrypted credential storage
- Multi-region monitoring (US, EU, Asia)

Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind
- Backend: Node.js, PostgreSQL
- Monitoring: Custom scheduler with distributed workers
- Diff engine: Custom recursive comparison algorithm

Pricing:
- Free: 3 APIs, hourly checks
- Pro $29/mo: 10 APIs, 15-min checks
- Team $99/mo: 50 APIs, 5-min checks

We just launched on Product Hunt too: [LINK]

Would love HN's technical feedback:
- What edge cases am I missing?
- Better diff algorithms?
- How would you architect the monitoring system?
- Security concerns with storing API credentials?

Free tier available if you want to try it: https://www.apishift.site

Thanks for reading! Happy to answer technical questions.
